## Fully assembled PCB
Alternatively, and if you do not want to build a PCB by yourself and like to buy one, you can do it here:

[![](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_sell.png)](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)

The price will be around 30eur plus postage fees.
(I will also deliver the assembled PCB with all the components in place at a fair aditonal cost).

This PCB is a #direct fit #replacement of the one found on the internet at sale. For example here: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9wRPxz

# [AeonLabs PCB Shields DC DC 1.8-28V Step up/down](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-PCB-Shields-DC2DC--1.8-28-V-step-up-down)
This is a pcb design for a DC DC [1.8;28]V step-up/down. Suitable as a add-on design for any other KiCad project.
Ro change the output voltage one needs to change the resistance in the voltage divider connected to pin 3 of the MT3608 IC.
