## Safety usage of the smart devices provided below
[where to buy](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki/Where-to-Buy) already assembled and ready to use.

The smart safety & health solutions available below, are for the kind of wireless aggression that behaves like ripples in a pond. For instance Wireless electromagnetic radios, including those found on smartphones, tablets, WIFI routers at home, and many more. (except those with directional beam forming technologies). This type of aggression has the characteristic to happen only during short periods of time, in the order of milliseconds or less regardless of electromagnetic radiation conditions and threshold limits of wireless networks.

   </a> <br>
<sup><a href="https://io.adafruit.com/aeonlabs/dashboards/em-sensor-data?kiosk=true" target="_blank">See on Adafruit.IO</a> the EMF & EMP measurements being made with a test device </sup>
</p>

Two concepts are very important to know and learn about: 
- the **superposition of different electromagnetic waves**, its meanings, and what resulting wave and EM energy produces (for instance an energy spike that produces an instantaneous flash of light).
- and the second concept is **wave pattern matching** to produce an EM wave with higher energy (for instance a high voltage, low amperage corona effect similar to those possible to see during a thunderstorm).

These concepts and subjects can be found easily on Google and in scientific publications.   


**The devices listed below are not able to detect wireless aggressions targeted to a person's body and individual. For instance, using some kind of beam-forming device or technologies**. For example, Laser and laser-like kind of devices and kind of technologies. 

**When installing any of the solutions provided below, take action and be conscious that the aggression/aggressor may change to other types and kinds of "wireless devices" the smart devices below are unable to detect**.  

**Always use the smart devices below connected to a public data repository with LIVE data streams. At the same time, notify the authorities immediately and provide the web address link where the public data repository can be found**. To my knowledge, data repositories based on Harvard's www.dataverse.org are currently the most suited (not ideal) for the smart solutions provided below. 

 :warning: **Be advised**


Known open data repositories partially compatible with these smart devices:
- www.dataverse.org [partial compatible] (open firmware provided here uses a dataverse repository API)
- www.figshare.com [partial compatible]
- www.datadryad.org [not compatible; no API]

## How to proceed
If you are certain your health-related problem is caused by some kind of wireless aggression, the first thing you need to do is to seek a wireless communications expert or engineer and ask him/her to audit your home, workplace (or another place you find it to be the root cause) to setup measurement devices (more than 2), for electromagnetic radiation detection (or other, for instance, photonics, also known as lasers) and do active monitoring 24/7. The monitoring setup needs to be able to do sensor data measurement uploads to an experimental data repository (see Table 1 above). At the same time is a mandatory requirement to notify authorities and include the web address link where sensor data is being uploaded and stored.

⚠️ **Only after you have those data measurements is advised to go to a conventional medical doctor/medicine.**

### Knonw symptoms of a wireless aggression
**Thermo and hygrometer imbalances**
- Extreme localized muscle tension
- Extremely localized muscle relaxation
  
Thermo and hygrometer imbalances require immediate wear of protective clothes regardless of weather or season. in particular, wearing a winter polar jacket (impermeable) during all times the aggression is happening and until the victim's body starts to be hot and comfortable to the point of showing a pink face.  The author recommends one from the "North Face" brand or with equal thermal and hygrometic properties. 

**Tinnitus and Insomnias** <br>
Tinnitus is the term for hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source. It's often described as “ringing in the ears”, although several sounds can be heard, including buzzing. humming. grinding. It’s often described as “ringing in the ears”, although several sounds can be heard, including:
- buzzing
- humming
- grinding
- hissing
- whistling

Some people may hear sounds similar to music or singing, and others hear noises that beat in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus). You can [read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus). In summary, every time one listens to a sound caused by electricity in the air,  if you're inside a building it means someone or some device is throwing electricity at you. An example of it is what is known as [tinnitus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus). 

Tinnitus and insomnias require immediate correction of [circadian rhythms](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx) in the victim.  Changes in the circadian rhythms due to tinnitus and insomnias cause thermo and hygrometer imbalances and therefore require immediate wear of protective clothes regardless of weather or season. in particular, wearing a winter polar jacket (impermeable) during all times the aggression is happening and until the victim's body starts to be hot and comfortable to the point of showing a pink face and also when all sleep cycles are resynchronized, usually after a good and restful nap. The author recommends one from the "North Face" brand or with equal thermal and hygrometric properties. <br>

### Where to complaint, where to report
If you are a Portuguese citizen can raise a complaint on the [Portuguese army website](https://canaldadenuncia.exercito.pt/?nav=pBeIW7qH). 

### Complementary medicines are known to assist treatment and cure of these kinds of health-related problems
- [Tai Ji Chuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi)
- [Acupunture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture)
- [Reiki Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiki)

## Comercial Health Related Wearables 
I recommend wearing a "Medical Grade" smartwatch when you know there's abnormal electromagnetic/photonic activity in the spaces most frequented (home, office, etc). The minimum specifications and requirements are:
- Telemedicine, i.e., sharing of medical* data with others through the  mobile app (see smartwatch suggested below)
- Able to upload all medical* data to a custom data repository, for instance to a dataverse (www.dataverse.org) (I haven't found one to date with this capability. Any manufacturer here willing to open-source their firmware and mobile app source code? I am willing to help and program this and other important functionalities ).
- Ability to measure REM sleep during the night (see smartwatch suggested below)
- App with the ability to plot data measurements in a chart (see smartwatch suggested below) for one to make instantaneous snapshots to doodle and comment when in an urgent situation or in urgent need.  

For the remainder of 2023 and the first half of 2024 the OEM smartwatch I recommend is sold on Aliexpress [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdOPKhh). 

⚠️ **Important remarks**
The accuracy of the smartwatch is not the most important requirement. What is important is for you to know the brand and model of all sensors built into the smartwatch.
- Smartwatches are mainly electronic devices and are prone to electromagnetic and even photonic interference., causing temporary malfunction and incorrect sensor measurements. This is expected for this kind of device. Therefore, it is important for the user to be willing to learn and document all errors a smartwatch may produce when collecting sensor measurements and append it to any kind of abnormal event it may be happening, simply because it is, most likely, a result of some kind of wireless aggression.

Below is a list of links with useful information about these kinds of abusive and many times criminal and terrorist usages.

**Exposure limits * Electric and magnetic fields in daily life * Regulation and control * Research and recommendations** <br>
Alternating fields with an extremely low frequency generate an electric current in the body. If the alternating fields are strong enough, this generated current can disrupt the functioning of nerves and muscles in the body and cause flashes of light in the field of vision. According to the recommendation of the Council 1999/519/EC, the following threshold values must not be exceeded by the fields so that these effects do not occur:
- for the electric field, the limit is 5 kilovolts per meter (5000 V/m or 5 kV/m);
- for the magnetic field, the limit is 100 microtesla (100 µT).
