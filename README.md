This repository is the main catalog for all my [white label hardware electronics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product) I prototype and made publicly available here on GitHub. In my PCB projects, I give preference to [EspressIF ESP32 line of microchips](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DepDnsn). However, designs are not limited to EspressIF.

There are now a total of **80** PCBs for smart devices, A.I. enabled, designed in [KiCad EDA](https://www.kicad.org/), and ready to download, order fabrication at a PCB factory or buy them on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/aeonlabs/) and [Gumroad](https://aeonlabs.gumroad.com) ready to install and use. While the reader browses this catalog, [don't forget to read the Wiki](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki) full of useful information about all smart PCBs available here.
<br>

<br>

There are now 2 ways to navigate my hardware electronics catalog. The icons below will take you  to another page where this catalog is displayed using a conventional landing page design & styling. If you like code and more technical information, browse this page instead.
 
The icon to the left is suited to all those users who are only looking for a solution to a problem and not into the real technical details.  The icon to the right will take you directly to a webpage with all hardware electronics currently at the [M.V.P. stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). If you're not into technical information and are here only to buy, this is the option for you.

## [Safety & Health](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Safety-Health) (7)

Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It is an essential aspect of overall health and impacts how individuals think, feel, and behave. While there is ongoing research on the potential effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on human health, current scientific evidence does not establish a direct link between EMR and mental health disorders. The primary concern regarding EMR revolves around its potential impacts on physical health, such as the increased risk of cancer or other physiological effects. However, maintaining a balanced lifestyle, including managing screen time and taking regular breaks from electronic devices, is advisable for overall well-being, including mental health.

They enhance road safety by minimizing human error, increase efficiency by optimizing routes and reducing traffic congestion, and provide mobility options for those who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled. Additionally, autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. While there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory frameworks and public acceptance, autonomous vehicles hold great promise for transforming our transportation systems and improving the way we move from one place to another.

DIY innovation refers to the practice of creating and developing solutions or inventions through do-it-yourself (DIY) methods. It involves individuals taking a hands-on approach to problem-solving and using their creativity and resourcefulness to design and build unique products or systems. DIY innovation encourages experimentation, collaboration, and the utilization of readily available tools, materials, and technologies. It empowers individuals to explore their ideas, overcome challenges, and bring their visions to life without relying on traditional institutions or established processes. DIY innovation fosters a culture of self-sufficiency, innovation, and personal growth, while also promoting affordability and accessibility in the development of new ideas and solutions. Below are a few, see the full list [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/DIY-Maker). If you're looking to expedite work, in [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/PCB-Shields) there's a list of PCB modules ready to deploy.
