### [Self-sensing asphalt](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Open-Scientific-Research) (soon . stay tuned.)

This paper presents an innovative bituminous asphalt composition mixed with carbon fibers and studies the self-sensing ability of this kind of composition. This innovative bituminous asphalt is able to transmit measured data using a Passive DAQ device with the necessary hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collection from an autonomous moving vehicle traveling at 300km/h on a tarmac highway.  Tarmac road condition measurements are made using modified RFID UHF technologies capable of doing electrical resistance measurements on the proposed self-sensing bituminous asphalt and sending it using UHF ISM band to an autonomous vehicle upon request.

### [Smart Traffic Beacon Barrier]() (soon . stay tuned.)

Retrofitting of flexible road beacons suing smart ultra low paowered smart electronics with the aim of actively detecting accidents. For example an accident happening. For example for active monitoring of dangerous driving and prevention of a possible accident that may happen later along that route. This smart electronic device prototype is easy to install into existing beacons connected to the internet via "narrow band" NB-IoT. Powered, from a flexible photovoltaic cell glued around the road beacon
